# Background

For this lab, we read a selection of articles that focus on the intersection of race and surveillance in K-12 education.

- Claire Galligan, Hannah Rosenfeld, Molly Kleinman, Shobita Parthasarathy, “[Cameras in the Classroom: Facial Recognition Technology in Schools](https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/research/research-report/cameras-classroom-facial-recognition-technology-schools)” *University of Michigan’s Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program* (25 August 2020)

- Jack Gillum and Jeff Kao, with photography by Adrienne Grunwald, “[Aggression Detectors: The Unproven, Invasive Surveillance Technology Schools Are Using to Monitor Students](https://features.propublica.org/aggression-detector/the-unproven-invasive-surveillance-technology-schools-are-using-to-monitor-students/)” *ProPublica* (25 June 2019)

- Jennifer Smith Richards, Jodi S. Cohen, and Lakeidra Chavis, with photography by Zbigniew Bzdak, “[The Quiet Rooms: Children are being locked away, alone and terrified, in schools across Illinois. Often, it’s against the law](https://features.propublica.org/illinois-seclusion-rooms/school-students-put-in-isolated-timeouts/)” *ProPublica Illinois* (19 November 2019)
  * [More reporting from this investigation, a collaboration between ProPublica Illinois and the Chicago Tribune](https://www.propublica.org/series/illinois-school-seclusions-timeouts-restraints)

- Coshandra Dillard, “[Envisioning School Safety Without Police](https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/fall-2021/envisioning-school-safety-without-police)” *Learning for Justice* (Fall 2021)

We'll start by focusing on the "Cameras in the Classroom" report. A few discussion questions, or places to start:
- What stood out to you when reading the executive summary? 
- What were able to tell about the scale or scope of facial recognition tech in schools? 
  * Number of schools, types of technology, number of cameras, number of impacted students, etc.
- What stood out to you from the report's organization or structure? Takeaways from particular sections you focused on or read in detail?
- Connections with previous class content/discussions
- Other initial questions/comments/observations

Our readings for this week challenge us to think expansively about what surveillance looks like and how it shows up particularly in K12 education. Thinking across these readings...
- What stood out to you in terms of how these articles present or discuss surveillance? Anything that was particularly challenging, surprising, eye-opening, etc?
- Where and how the intersection of race and surveillance shows up
- What kinds of "othering" happens via surveillance technologies in education, thinking about race as well as gender, sexuality, ability and disability, neurotypically and neurodivergence, socio-economic class, cultural and linguistic identity, religious practice, etc.
- Connections with previous class content/discussions
- Other questions/comments/observations

Some of our content for this week- specifically the "Cameras in the Classroom" report and Coshandra Dillard's *Learning for Justice* article- make specific policy recommendations or ask us to imagine alternative frameworks and possibilities for surveillance in K12 education.

# Lab Options

The lab procedure document includes four (4) different prompt options. Folks can go in-depth with one prompt or explore a couple of prompts. Collaboration is encouraged.

## Prompt 1: School Policies/Regulations

As we see across this week's readings, policies around racialized surveillance tech (facial recognition, SROs, etc) is often highly localized and coordinated at the district/community level.

For example, the South Bend Community School Corporation has been having an ongoing conversation around the role of SROs leading up to the approval of an agreement in December 2021. Sources of related information include...
- [SBCSC website](http://sb.school/)
- [SBCSC School Board Documents](https://go.boarddocs.com/in/sbcsc/Board.nsf/Public)
- [South Bend Tribune](https://www.southbendtribune.com/) (weekly paper)
- [NDSMC Observer](https://ndsmcobserver.com/2021/10/south-bend-community-advocates-against-police-officers-in-schools/) (student paper)
- [WSBT](https://wsbt.com/) (local CBS affiliate)
- [WNDU](https://www.wndu.com/) (local NBC affiliate)
- [ABC57](https://www.abc57.com/) (local ABC affiliate)
- [South Bend Police Department statement](https://police.southbendin.gov/press-release/clearing-sbpd-school-resource-officer-misinformation)

Another example includes a database of district policies and news stories for Iowa schools.
- [Link to database](https://airtable.com/shrcAos4QdCkA0BC7)
- [Link to more background on this project](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/S2PP-Data#qualitative-data)

Select a specific community or district and explore local news coverage, school/district websites, community organizations (PTO, BLM, etc).
- What surveillance tech is in use (or is under consideration)?
- What policies or regulations exist (or are under consideration)?
- Who are the stakeholders, and has their been any conversation/dialogue/pushback around the adoption of existing or proposed surveillance tech?
- Where and how can we see race and surveillance at work?
  * Connections with this week's readings and/or previous course content?
- Other observations/comments/questions

## Prompt 2: Tech Deep Dive (Company or Product)

## Prompt 3: Digital Surveillance in Higher Education

The kinds of surveillance technologies we're looking at this week aren't unique to K12 education- they also show up on college campuses in a variety of contexts.

OIT maintains [a Google Sheet](https://nd.service-now.com/nd_portal?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0014445&sys_kb_id=4192330bdb010150310fa94ed396195f&spa=1) with software titles that have been approved for use at ND.

Some tools that might show up in ND classes:
- PollEverywhere
- Canvas
- Google Classroom
- Sakai
- Perusall
- Piazza
- Panopto
- Gradescope
- Kahoot

In some cases, folks can download their user data from these platforms.
- Let Prof. Walden know (via email) if you want your Canvas data/analytics for this course.
- OIT will likely ask questions, but you could [submit a ticket](https://nd.service-now.com/nd_portal) requesting your data/analytics for a specific enterprise tool or platform (Canvas, Panopto, etc).
