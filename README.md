# Background

For this lab, we read a selection of articles that focus on the intersection of race and surveillance in K-12 education.

- Claire Galligan, Hannah Rosenfeld, Molly Kleinman, Shobita Parthasarathy, “[Cameras in the Classroom: Facial Recognition Technology in Schools](https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/research/research-report/cameras-classroom-facial-recognition-technology-schools)” *University of Michigan’s Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program* (25 August 2020)

- Jack Gillum and Jeff Kao, with photography by Adrienne Grunwald, “[Aggression Detectors: The Unproven, Invasive Surveillance Technology Schools Are Using to Monitor Students](https://features.propublica.org/aggression-detector/the-unproven-invasive-surveillance-technology-schools-are-using-to-monitor-students/)” *ProPublica* (25 June 2019)

- Jennifer Smith Richards, Jodi S. Cohen, and Lakeidra Chavis, with photography by Zbigniew Bzdak, “[The Quiet Rooms: Children are being locked away, alone and terrified, in schools across Illinois. Often, it’s against the law](https://features.propublica.org/illinois-seclusion-rooms/school-students-put-in-isolated-timeouts/)” *ProPublica Illinois* (19 November 2019)

We'll start by focusing on the "Cameras in the Classroom" report. A few discussion questions, or places to start:
- What stood out to you when reading the executive summary? 
- What were able to tell about the scale or scope of facial recognition tech in schools? 
  * Number of schools, types of technology, number of cameras, number of impacted students, etc.
- What stood out to you from the report's organization or structure? Takeaways from particular sections you focused on or read in detail?
- Connections with previous class content/discussions
- Other initial questions/comments/observations

Our readings for this week challenge us to think expansively about what surveillance looks like and how it shows up particularly in K12 education. Thinking across these readings...
- What stood out to you in terms of how these articles present or discuss surveillance? Anything that was particularly challenging, surprising, eye-opening, etc?
- Where and how the intersection of race and surveillance shows up
- What kinds of "othering" happens via surveillance technologies in education, thinking about race as well as gender, sexuality, ability and disability, neurotypically and neurodivergence, socio-economic class, cultural and linguistic identity, religious practice, etc.
- Connections with previous class content/discussions
- Other questions/comments/observations

Some of our content for this week- specifically the "Cameras in the Classroom" report and Coshandra Dillard's *Learning for Justice* article- make specific policy recommendations or ask us to imagine alternative frameworks and possibilities for surveillance in K12 education.
